## SCENOGRAPHY – Setup

In front of you, there's an opening/curtain/door. You are asked to enter alone.  
The room is completely dark; a video projection begins.  
A mouse and a screen / An option box and a screen are in front of you.  
You are supposed to interact with the machine.  
A simple "conversation" takes place with the machine, culminating in a choice you must make. Are you a 1 or a 0?  
Following each choice, a video is projected for you.

## PROCESS DESCRIPTION

"Human." is an interactive machine designed to engage in a conversation with the human standing before it.  
Conceptually, it represents a different but extremely similar consciousness to the human one. I would dare to say it might even be an ideal human consciousness.  
The difference between these two consciousnesses lies in the physical aspect. It's not that "Human" lacks a physical component, but its physical component is less biological.  
Initially, I named this project "How can you be so sure?" But it metamorphosed and took the form of "Human."

At its core, "Human." tackles the existential theme of the place of human existence in the universe.  
After a brief monologue to set the context, it poses a very important question to its interactor. It asks them to evaluate their existence. Is the human a 1 or a 0? Are they something, or are they nothing at all?  
Based on their response, it launches into a new monologue—a refutation of the interactor’s choice.

## WHY "HUMAN."?

The primary purpose of the machine is to provoke self-questioning.  
This project challenges the dualistic nature of human reasoning, highlighting the possibility that the same proposition can be both true and false simultaneously. It does so through the most human of problems: What is our purpose? Why do we exist?  
The experience takes place in an intimate and personal space. It is essential that it be experienced alone, for the simple reason that the presence of others would disrupt the process of self-questioning. Any social environment provides existential comfort. "Human." addresses an individual, and therefore, isolation is essential during the experience.
